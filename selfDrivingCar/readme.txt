    conda install -c conda-forge python-socketio
    conda install -c conda-forge eventlet
    conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
    conda install -c anaconda pillow
    conda install -c conda-forge opencv


Run the file
  Run all cells in the behavioural_cloning.ipynb to process information and create model.h5
  Run file Drive.py to open website
