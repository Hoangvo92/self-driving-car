# self-driving-car

This is a deep learning project to build a program for self-driving car based on lessons on Udemy course.

     Self-driving cars have rapidly become one of the most transformative technologies to emerge. Fuelled by Deep Learning algorithms, they are continuously driving our society forward and creating new opportunities in the mobility sector. 

In this project, I learned to use Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques to Build an Autonomous Car with Python

Other files in the respository are samples. The main focus is in the folder selfDrivingCar/

## Installation

   Follow the link to install the Self driving car simulator to collect data:
       https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
       
   We need Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, and python 3 to run the files
   The required packages: os, numpy, matplotlib, keras, sklearn, imgaug, opencv, pandas, ntpath, random, flask
   
        """conda install -c anaconda flask""" 
        """conda install -c conda-forge python-socketio"""
        """conda install -c conda-forge eventlet"""
        """conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow"""
        """conda install -c anaconda pillow"""
        """conda install -c conda-forge opencv


## Run the information processing and website
  Run all cells in the behavioural_cloning.ipynb to process information and create model.h5
  Run file Drive.py to open website
